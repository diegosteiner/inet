TODO:
 - doppler shift
 - polarization
 - preamble/pilot/sychronization
 - mimo, antenna gain

model:
 - mobility (position)
 - antenna (mobility)
 - propagation (speed)
 - attenuation (free space: alpha)
 - background noise (isotropic: power)
 - radio (receiver antenna, transmitter antenna, codec, modem, shaper, converter)
 - radio channel (propagation, attenuation, background noise, radios, transmissions)
 - listening (??? filter model)
 - transmission (start position/time, end position/time, analog model)
 - reception (transmission, start position/time, end position/time, analog model)
 - noise (start position/time, end position/time, analog model)
 - loss (factor)
 - codec (coding scheme, header bit length, header bit rate, payload bit rate)
 - modem (modulation scheme, preamble symbol length)
 - shaper (?)
 - converter (power, carrier frequency, bandwidth)

transmission:
 - packet model (length, bits)
 - bit model (crc, fec, header bit length, total length, bits)
 - symbol model (modulation, preamble symbol length, total length, symbols)
 - sample model (pulse shape, length, samples)
 - analog model (power, duration, carrier frequency, bandwidth) 

reception:
 - analog model indication (snir)
 - sample model indication (rssi)
 - symbol model indication (symbol error rate, symbol error count)
 - bit model indication (bit error rate, bit error count)
 - packet model indication (packet error rate, packet successful)

algorithms:
 - compute CRC
 - check CRC
 - FEC encode
 - FEC decode
 - Modulate
 - Demodulate
 - Shape pulse
 - Filter pulse
 - insert preamble/pilot
 - synchronize
